         <p class="col-lg-6">Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity, abundance of difference in taste, and is one of the most popular 
        in the world, with influences abroad. Italian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only 
        four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate 
        preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region and by country as well.<br><br>
        Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated with variations throughout the country. Cheese and wine 
        are a major part of the cuisine, with many variations and Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) (regulated appellation)
         laws. Coffee, specifically espresso, has become important in Italian cuisine.
